# Airline Reservation System

This is a Java-based command-line application that simulates an airline reservation system. It was developed by Juan Pablo Acevedo and Carlos Andres Tafurt as part of their undergraduate systems engineering coursework.

## Description

The Airline Reservation System allows passengers to book seats on a flight, cancel bookings, and view available seats. It supports three classes of seats: First Class, Business Class, and Economy Class. Bookings are stored in memory using Java Maps and PriorityQueues.

## Requirements

- Java](https://www.java.com/): The code generated in PlantUML is in Java, so you need to have the Java JDK installed on your system to be able to compile and run the generated code.

- IDE of your choice: To compile and run the Java code, you will need an integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice, such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, etc.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Run the `Main` class to start the application.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the system.
